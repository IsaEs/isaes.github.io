      <description>Reading and writing files is from the first requirement of programming. When it comes to a point you will probably have to code. When I started to computer engineering our first-week assignments include reading and writing from file and includes some calculations. From then in my jobs and project, i often need reading and writing from the filesystem.
I genuinely love to use javascript. It&amp;rsquo;s my first personal choice for when I need to create some scripting solution for my tasks.</description>
